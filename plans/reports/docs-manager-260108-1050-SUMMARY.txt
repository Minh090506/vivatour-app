3. Review Phase 07-09 roadmap with stakeholders for prioritization
4. Add API endpoint usage examples to codebase-summary

SHORT-TERM (Next 2 weeks):
1. Create Storybook for component documentation
2. Set up automated documentation generation from code
3. Add code example snippets throughout codebase-summary
4. Create deployment runbook for production

LONG-TERM (Next month):
1. Implement interactive architecture diagrams
2. Set up automated documentation sync with code changes
3. Create video walkthroughs for new developer onboarding
4. Build internal wiki/knowledge base for team

================================================================================
